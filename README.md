# Machine Learning Algorithms
-------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this repository is to understand the principles of machine learning, so all the codes are built without any machine learning library such as sklearn.

#### 1. Factorization Machines
#### 2. Gaussian Process
#### 3. Gradient Descent with several step size functions
#### 4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm
#### 5. Linear Regression
#### 6. Logistic Regression
